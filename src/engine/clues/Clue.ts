/**
 * A clue constrains where a subject (a suspect) can stand.
 *
 * - `test` validates a complete solution. It receives the whole puzzle so
 *   social clues can inspect other people's rooms and attributes.
 * - `candidateCells` returns the fixed set of cells a subject could occupy
 *   considering only this clue (used for deduction). Relational/social clues
 *   return `null` because their candidates depend on other people.
 * - `forbiddenForOthers` returns cells no other person may occupy when the clue
 *   holds (e.g. "only person on a carpet").
 * - `describe` returns an i18n descriptor — never hard-coded text.
