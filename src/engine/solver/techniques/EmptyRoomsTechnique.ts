/**
 * Board clue "exactly N rooms are empty" — two forward deductions a human makes
 * straight from the rule, no trial:
 *
 *  A. Enough rooms are ALREADY certainly occupied (R−N of them) ⇒ every other room
 *     must stay empty ⇒ nobody may be placed there. (The player's "B can't go here,
 *     that would leave the wrong number of rooms empty".)
 *  B. Exactly N rooms can no longer hold anyone ⇒ every other room must be occupied ⇒
 *     a room only one person can still reach confines that person to it.
 *
 * The victim never opens a NEW room (it always shares the murderer's), so a room counts
 * as occupied as soon as one suspect is certain to be in it.
