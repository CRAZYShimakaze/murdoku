/**
 * "Which room stays empty?" — the deduction a human makes straight from a "N rooms empty"
 * clue when a room can only be reached by very few suspects: try seating a possible occupant
 * there and follow the consequences; if EVERY seating runs into a dead end, nobody can be in
 * the room, so it is one of the empty ones.
 *
 * Concretely, for a room only a handful of (suspect, cell) placements could fill, each is
 * tried on a copy and the base rules are propagated to a fixpoint. If they all reach a
 * contradiction (an empty domain, an unfillable row/column, or the victim left without a
 * possible murderer), no suspect can occupy the room — and the victim never sits alone — so
 * the room is empty and is crossed out for everyone.
 *
 * This is a bounded, room-focused contradiction ("könnte die Garage belegt sein? Nein, dann
 * geht Spalte 9 nicht mehr auf → sie ist leer"), not an open-ended search: only rooms with a
 * small number of possible occupants are probed, so every argument stays short.
