/**
 * "No empty rooms" + as many suspects as rooms ⇒ each room holds exactly one suspect.
 * (The victim only ever shares the murderer's room — the murder rule — so every room
 * still needs a suspect of its own; equal counts force a 1-to-1 match.) That turns the
 * rooms into a Sudoku-like unit over the suspects:
 *  - a suspect confined to one room reserves it (no other suspect may enter);
 *  - a room only one suspect can still reach confines that suspect to it.
 * Purely forward and sound — it only ever fires when the bijection provably holds.
