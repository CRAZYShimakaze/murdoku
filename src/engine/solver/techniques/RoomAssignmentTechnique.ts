/**
 * Room bijection under an "exactly N rooms empty" clue, once the empty rooms are known.
 *
 * With R rooms, N of them provably empty, and S suspects, the R−N occupied rooms hold all
 * S suspects, so `S − (R−N)` suspects sit in a room that already has someone (the "surplus"
 * doublers). The ONLY suspects that can double up are the ones a clue forces to share a room
 * ("never alone" — alone-with-a-man, not-alone, same-room-as-X …). So when EXACTLY the
 * never-alone suspects account for the surplus, every OTHER suspect is a room's sole
 * occupant: the non-doubler suspects match the occupied rooms one-to-one. That bijection is
 * a Sudoku-like unit over them:
 *  - a non-doubler confined to one room reserves it (no OTHER non-doubler may enter);
 *  - a room only one non-doubler can reach confines that suspect to it.
 *
 * Sound: only fires when the surplus is exactly 1 and there is exactly one never-alone
 * suspect (or the surplus is 0 with none) — then each occupied room provably holds a distinct
 * non-doubler, so the real solution always respects the bijection. Restricting to that case
 * avoids the unsound corner where two doublers could share one room, leaving it with no
 * non-doubler.
