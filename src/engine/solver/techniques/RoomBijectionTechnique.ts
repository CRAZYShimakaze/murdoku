/**
 * "No empty rooms" room split — the closed-group room matching a human does straight from
 * the rule, no trial:
 *
 *  A closed group of k suspects whose combined still-possible rooms are exactly k rooms,
 *  and NO other suspect can reach any of those rooms, must fill them one-to-one — every
 *  room needs a suspect (no room is empty; the victim only ever shares the murderer's
 *  room, so it never fills one on its own), only these k suspects can be there, and there
 *  are exactly k of them ⇒ each room holds exactly one of the group.
 *
 *  That bijection alone confines the group to its territory (already known). What it ADDS
 *  is symmetry-breaking via a positional clue between two members: if putting suspect X in
 *  room rx would force partner Y into a room where their "X was north of Y / east of …"
 *  clue can never hold (e.g. the guest room lies entirely north of the bedroom, and H is
 *  north of E ⇒ E can't take the guest room), that cell is impossible.
 *
 *  Sound: a cell is removed only when NO assignment of the group to the rooms — with the
 *  suspect on that cell's room — lets every positional clue between two members hold. The
 *  real solution is such an assignment, so its cells always survive.
