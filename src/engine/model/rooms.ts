/**
 * Water rooms — a lake / sea / ocean area. They are drawn as a WATER surface with grassy
 * banks (see the board renderer) and furnished by the `lake` archetype, but mechanically
 * a water room is a perfectly NORMAL room: its empty floor is occupiable, so a person can
 * stand in the water just like on any floor (the legend states this as a global rule).
 *
 * This is the single source of truth shared by the generator (furnishing → archetype),
 * the board renderer (water look) and the legend (the "walkable" hint). `pond` is left
 * OUT on purpose — it stays a green garden, not open water.
